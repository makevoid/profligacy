h2. Profligacy ~_( the swing reducer )_~

Profligacy is a JRuby library that makes building "Swing":http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/
Graphical User Interface *much* easier than with Raw code.  It's not
a builder as with many other projects, but instead a simple Ruby way
to structure the UI for the 80% common cases you'll encounter.

It's actively used in the "Utu":http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/
"iHate":http://ihate.rubyforge.org/ client.  iHate started as a 
RubyCocoa project and then convert to JRuby and Swing.

The purpose of Profligacy is *not* to be a complete way of hiding
Swing components from you.  You'll still be making JButtons and 
JLabels, you'll just be putting them into a Ruby idiomatic code
structure that doesn't make your eyes hemorrhage diarrhea like when
you try to code in Java.

The only real innovation in Profligacy is a simpler way to configure
a "GroupLayout":http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/GroupLayout.html
using a simple regex/wiki style syntax.  This is a work in progress, but
it should make building GUIs much much easier.

h2. Features

* Doesn't hide swing from you so you have full access to components.
* Separates the components from the interactions for clarity.
* Decouples the layout from the component building so you can build in any order you like.
* Hides the ugliness and complexity of Java's Listener and Runnables.
* Allows for simplified Ruby proc or method based callbacks.
* Slick layout mechanism called "LEL":lel.html that makes it easy to do big stuff.
* You don't have to use it and are expected to do complex components directly.

h2. Installation

The best way to install Profligacy is through the JRuby version of 
RubyGems (adjusting for wherever *your* jruby/bin is located):

  /opt/jruby/bin/gem install profligacy

However, that causes some problems somtimes with an Out-of-Memory error
so you can get the files from "the project page":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3605
and install them directly with:

  /opt/jruby/bin/gem install profligacy-VERSION-jruby.gem

Where _VERSION_ would be the latest.


h2. Getting Started

Just check out the "samples":sample.html for a few examples and read
the "RDoc":/rdoc/ to get started.

h2. The Author

Profligacy is written by "Zed A. Shaw":http://www.zedshaw.com/

h2. The License

While the Utu project is GPL licensed, Profligacy is Ruby licensed
so that anyone can use it.

h2. Why Not Cheri?

"This file":/profligacy/cheri_constants.rb from the "Cheri":http://cheri.rubyforge.org/ project is why.
