h2. RubyForge Project

Profligacy is hosted by "RubyForge":http://www.rubyforge.org/
under the "iHate":http://rubyforge.org/projects/ihate/ project
where you can access additional services:

* "Project Page":http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/ihate/

There's other available services, but those are the main ones.  I actually do use all of
the above for the project.
