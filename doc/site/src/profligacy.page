h2. Where'd Profligacy Come From?

I was having trouble coming up with a name for a project that
simplified such a huge library.  The sad fact is that, after trying
nearly every GUI system on the planet, doing a GUI with JRuby and
Swing is pretty nice.  Just compare even the raw code for a simple
GUI with the crap you write for Ruby/Tk, Ruby/Qt, or Ruby/GTK and
you'll see what I mean.

However, all that Java made me want to cry.  So I started working on 
a way to simplify the work down without dumbing the power of Swing
down too much.

That's when I got a spam with the following subject line:

  pasty vivacity profligacy::

After looking up "profligacy":http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/profligacy and seeing:

#	shameless dissoluteness.
#	reckless extravagance.
#	great abundance.

I realized it was the perfect description of Swing *and* trying to
use Swing to do a GUI.
